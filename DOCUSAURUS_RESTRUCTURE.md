# Docusaurus Restructure Summary

## Problem
The Docusaurus deployment on Vercel was failing because the documentation markdown files were in `/docs/` while the Docusaurus configuration was in `/docs-site/`, causing the build to fail when looking for referenced documents.

## Solution
Restructured the project to follow the standard Docusaurus layout where everything lives in the `docs/` directory:

### Changes Made

1. **Moved all markdown files** from `docs/` to `docs/docs/`
   - All documentation markdown files are now in the standard Docusaurus `docs/` subdirectory

2. **Moved Docusaurus configuration** from `docs-site/` to `docs/`
   - `package.json`
   - `docusaurus.config.ts`
   - `sidebars.ts`
   - `babel.config.js`
   - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.base.json`
   - `yarn.lock`

3. **Moved supporting directories** from `docs-site/` to `docs/`
   - `src/` (custom pages and CSS)
   - `static/` (images and assets)

4. **Updated configuration files**
   - `docusaurus.config.ts`: Changed docs path from `../docs` to `./docs`
   - `sidebars.ts`: Removed non-existent references (`pow-architecture`, `pow-implementation-status`) and added `POW_CORRECT_ARCHITECTURE`
   - `README.md` (root): Updated all doc paths from `docs/` to `docs/docs/`
   - `README-docusaurus.md`: Updated all instructions to reflect new structure

5. **Deleted old structure**
   - Removed entire `docs-site/` directory

6. **Added configuration files**
   - Created `docs/.gitignore` to ignore build artifacts
   - Created `vercel.json` at project root to configure Vercel deployment

## New Structure

```

## Vercel Deployment

The `vercel.json` file at the project root ensures Vercel:
1. Installs dependencies in the `docs/` directory
2. Runs the build command from `docs/`
3. Outputs to `docs/build/`

### Vercel Settings
When deploying on Vercel, you can now set:
- **Root Directory**: `docs`
- **Build Command**: `yarn build`
- **Output Directory**: `build`
- **Install Command**: `yarn install`

The deployment should now work correctly without the previous errors about missing document IDs.

## Local Development

To work on the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
yarn install
yarn start  # Starts dev server at http://localhost:3000
yarn build  # Creates production build
```

## Build Status

✅ Build tested successfully with `yarn build`
✅ All document references resolved correctly
⚠️  Some broken internal links exist (configured as warnings, won't break build)

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to git
2. Push to your repository
3. Re-deploy on Vercel (should work automatically)
4. Optionally fix the broken internal links reported during build
