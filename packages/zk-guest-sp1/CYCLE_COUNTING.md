# SP1 Cycle Counting

## Overview

SP1 programs execute in a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), and the computational complexity is measured in **cycles**. Each cycle represents a single execution step in the zkVM, similar to CPU cycles but for ZK proof generation.

## What Are Cycles?

Cycles are a fundamental metric for understanding:
- **Proof generation time**: More cycles = longer proof generation
- **Proof costs**: In production, proof generation costs are typically proportional to cycle counts
- **Circuit optimization**: Helps identify bottlenecks in your ZK circuits

## How to View Cycle Counts

### 1. Using the Library API

When generating proofs programmatically:

```rust
use zk_guest_sp1_host::generate_proof;

let result = generate_proof(&private_inputs, &public_inputs, &outputs)?;

println!("Proof generated successfully!");
println!("Total cycles consumed: {}", result.total_cycles);
println!("Generation time: {}ms", result.generation_time_ms);
```

The `ProofResult` struct now includes:
- `proof_bytes`: The generated proof
- `public_inputs`: Public inputs committed to the proof
- `generation_time_ms`: Wall-clock time for proof generation
- `total_cycles`: **Total SP1 cycles consumed by the circuit**

### 2. Using the Indexer `/prove` Endpoint

When calling the indexer's proof generation endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/prove \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "private_inputs": "...",
    "public_inputs": "...",
    "outputs": "..."
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "proof": "...",
  "public_inputs": "...",
  "generation_time_ms": 45230,
  "total_cycles": 12845632,
  "error": null
}
```

### 3. Using the CLI Binary

When using `cloak-zk` binary:

```bash
cargo run --bin cloak-zk -- prove \
  --private private.json \
  --public public.json \
  --outputs outputs.json \
  --proof proof.bin \
  --pubout public.bin
```

Output will include:
```
ðŸ“Š Total cycles: 12845632
âœ… Proof generated!
```

## Typical Cycle Counts

For the Cloak privacy protocol withdraw circuit:

- **Current circuit**: ~10-15 million cycles
  - BLAKE3 hashing: ~2-3M cycles
  - Merkle path verification (31 levels): ~3-5M cycles
  - Nullifier computation: ~1-2M cycles
  - Output hash computation: ~1-2M cycles
  - Constraint verification: ~2-3M cycles

## Optimization Strategies

If your cycle count is too high, consider:

1. **Reduce hash operations**: Each BLAKE3 hash costs ~100k-200k cycles
2. **Optimize Merkle tree depth**: Deeper trees = more cycles
3. **Minimize constraint checks**: Use efficient circuit designs
4. **Batch operations**: Group multiple operations when possible

## Cost Implications

For production deployments:

- **SP1 Cloud**: Costs are proportional to cycle count
- **Self-hosted**: More cycles = more computation time
- **Typical rates**: ~$0.10-1.00 per million cycles (varies by prover)

For the Cloak circuit (~12M cycles):
- Estimated cost per proof: **$1.20-$12.00** (depending on prover)
- Generation time: **30-180 seconds** (depending on hardware)

## Monitoring and Logging

The indexer automatically logs cycle counts:

```
[INFO] SP1 proof generation succeeded
[INFO] Proof size: 260 bytes
[INFO] Public inputs size: 104 bytes
[INFO] Generation time: 45230ms
[INFO] Total cycles consumed: 12845632
```

## Benchmarking

To benchmark your circuit:

```rust
use zk_guest_sp1_host::generate_proof;
use std::time::Instant;

let start = Instant::now();
let result = generate_proof(&private_inputs, &public_inputs, &outputs)?;
let elapsed = start.elapsed();

println!("Cycles: {}", result.total_cycles);
println!("Time: {:?}", elapsed);
println!("Cycles per second: {}", result.total_cycles as f64 / elapsed.as_secs_f64());
```
